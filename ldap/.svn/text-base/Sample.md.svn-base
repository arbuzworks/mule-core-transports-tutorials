### Step 3: Configure application

##### Set connection properties.
    
We need to provide values for the connection to LDAP. Open **src/main/app/flows/mule-app.properties** file and add the following lines: 
```ini
ldap.userDn=uid=john.doe,ou=Employees,ou=People,o=company.com
ldap.password=password
ldap.url=ldap://url:389   
```

Please note that all values are specific for your local environment. Correct attributes and credentials should be obtained from your system administrator.

You will see the window with the **Global Element Properties** header, adjust its general tab as it is shown on the following image.

Please note that the LDAP search filter uses the **name** request parameter passed from the HTTP Endpoint to the LDAP Connector.  

##### Adding and adjusting *Collection Splitter* element.

*    Find the **Collection Splitter** element using filter and drag it to the **search** flow.
*    Double click that element and adjust its general tab as it is shown on the following image.

### Step 5: Run project

*    Right Click **src/main/app/demo.xml \> Run As/Mule Application**.

![Run Project](images/step5-1.png) 

*    Check the console to see when the application starts.  

You should see a log message on the console:  
 
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    
    + Started app 'demo'                                       +    
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   

### Step 6: Test search flow

*    When the application is started, open your browser and point it to [http://localhost:8081/ldapSearch?name=john](http://localhost:8081/ldapSearch?name=john).
*    You should see detailed information related to the people with the name John. In our case only one record has been matched. Changing the value of the **name** parameter in url you may get different results. Also please note that the set of fields in result will differ depending on your LDAP configuration.
